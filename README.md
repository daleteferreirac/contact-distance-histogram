# protein–ligand-distance-histogram 
Structural bioinformatics project focused on analyzing protein–ligand contact distances from PDB structures.

## Overview:
Extracts atomic coordinates for protein atoms (ATOM records) and a specific ligand (HETATM).

The coordinates are returned as NumPy arrays for further analysis.

## Future Improvements

- Add distance calculation between protein and ligand
- Implement contact map generation
- Add error handling
- Support multiple ligands
- Add unit tests
